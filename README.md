# Virtual Memo Work

## What is it?

So in fact, you generate a binary file, and insert there a bitmap for 24 values

and then 24 integers. There are a lot of pages in file consisting of bitmap+int values

Main task is to copy whole page(not the whole file), change/delete/update value 

and write updated page back.
